TransWorld NG: Empower Traffic Simulation via AIGC

Transworld 2.0 is a data-driven and multiscale traffic simulation model that leverages the power of AIGC (Artificial Intelligence and Graph Computing) techniques to simulate complex traffic behavior and relationships.

Checkout these features!

1. A unified and adaptable data description structure to model diverse agents and various relationships in complex traffic systems.
2. A heterogeneous graph learning framework that automates the generation of the behavior models by incorporating diverse and complex traffic data. 
3. Multi-scale traffic simulation framework with adaptive scaling capabilit that allows modeling the temporal and spatial complexity of traffic systems at multi-scales.
